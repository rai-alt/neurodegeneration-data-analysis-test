# Data Analysis Run I

Exploratory analysis of public dementia datasets, specifically on 
data cleaning, demographic and risk-factor patterns with basic bioinformatics annotations.

---
## Objectives
- Explore demographic and risk-factor patterns in dementia datasets
- Perform cleaning, structuring and visualisation of dataset features using Python
- Annotate genes and proteins linked to neurodegeneration

---
## Data Sources
- Public repository + ADNI-style dataset + UK Biobank-esque sample subset
- Neurodegeneration related gene and protein reference sources using Uniprot, NCBI, and Ensembl
- 

---
## Methods
- `pandas`: used for cleaning and feature engineering
- `matplotlib` : used for visualisation
- Annotations of candidate genes and proteins using the aformentioned public bioinformatics databases

---
## Current Progress
- [❇️] Dataset identified & imported  
- [ ] Initial cleaning / missing value handling  
- [ ] First-pass demographic plots  
- [ ] Annotation pipeline draft

---
## Next Steps

## Notes
Please note that repository is worked on alongside a BSc Biomedical Science degree as a bioinformatics learning and research exercise ❗️
